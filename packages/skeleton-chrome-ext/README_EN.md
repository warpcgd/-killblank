## Background

> The function provided by pre-rendering can only solve the problem of white screen, but this content is actually just a frame generated by css and html, and there are problems such as the structure of the page and the actual inconsistency, and excessive white space.

## Principle

Based on [a scheme for automatically generating skeleton screens](https://github.com/Jocs/jocs.github.io/issues/22), I modified [skeleton](https://github.com/ElemeFE /page-skeleton-webpack-plugin/tree/master/src/script) code, when the Google plug-in is loaded, inject it into the page, select the current element, run `outputSkeleton`, you can get the html&css of the skeleton screen
